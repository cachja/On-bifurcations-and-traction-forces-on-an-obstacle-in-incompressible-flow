# DefCon Solver for Steady Navier–Stokes Solutions

This minimal working example implements continuation and deflation (DefCon) for computing steady states of the 2D-1 Turek–Schäfer flow-around-cylinder benchmark. It can track multiple solution branches over a range of Reynolds numbers from 0 to 1000 with a step of 1.33.

**Note:** This solver is very time-consuming. We do **not** recommend running it; it is included only for completeness.
