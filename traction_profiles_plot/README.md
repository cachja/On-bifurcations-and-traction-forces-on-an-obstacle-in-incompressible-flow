# Traction Profiles of Steady States

Minimal working example that computes and plots pointwise traction from steady-state solutions. By default, the script computes the solutions directly, as precomputed results from DefCon are not included due to their size.

## Usage

Run the script with:

`python steady_state_traction_plot.py`

## Results

The script generates plots of the traction profiles along the obstacle surface. Example figures are saved in the `traction_profiles/` folder for inspection or further analysis.
